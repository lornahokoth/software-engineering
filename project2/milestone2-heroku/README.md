## Problems Encountered

> a) Two technical issues I encounter were using Media wiki: Query API, deploying heroku
> b.) The problem I know that is still exisiting is using the Query API, the problem was the title for the movie in TMDB is different to Wiki so when trying to search for the movie in wiki it would return ""No wiki found with that name. What I would impove is styling my page better had I had more time to make it user friendly. Considering the fact it takes a lot of time to make sure the HTML and CSS are working properly and approach one problem at a time instead all at once.
